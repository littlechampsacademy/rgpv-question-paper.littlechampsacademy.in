		Q. 3. Write the functions of operating system and explain its types. 
			 
		  </p>
          <p class="answer"><b>Answer : </b><br> 

<p class="answer">Ans. <b>The main functions performed by the operating 
system are –</b></p>
<p class="answer"><b>(i) Process Management</b> – This module takes care of 
the creation and deletion of processes, scheduling of various system resources 
to the different process requesting them, and providing mechanisms for 
synchronization and communication among processes.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(ii) Memory Management</b> – This module takes care of 
the allocation and deallocation of memory space to the various programs in need 
of this resource.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(iii) File Management</b> -- This module takes care of 
file related activities such as organization, storing, retrieval, naming, 
sharing, and protection of files.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(iv) I/0 Devices Management</b> – This module takes care 
of I/O devices to be used in efficient manner.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(v) Security</b> – This module of an operating system 
protects the resources and information of a computer against destruction and 
unauthorized access.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(vi) Command Interpretation</b> - This module of an 
operating system takes care of interpreting user commands and directing the 
system resources to handle the requests.</p>
<p class="answer">In addition to these major functions, an operating system 
also performs few other functions such as keeping an account of users (or 
processes) use how much and what kinds of computer resources, maintenance of log 
of system usage by all users, and maintenance of internal time clock.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>Types of Operating System</b></p>
<p class="answer">The operating systems can be divided into the following six 
major categories -</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(i) Batch Processing Operating Systems</b> – The batch 
operating systems are capable of executing only one job at a time. The jobs or 
programs submitted by different users are grouped into batches with similar 
needs and are run through the computer as a group. The jobs in the batch are 
processed on the first-come-first-serve basis. After getting an appropriate 
command from the operator, the batch operating system starts executing the jobs 
one by one. The execution of a particular job generally involves three major 
activities, which are reading the job from the input device, executing the job 
by the system and printing the calculated result on to the output device.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>The main advantages of batch processing operating 
systems are -</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) The computer systems having the batch operating systems 
were very efficient because the idle time for these systems was very small.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) These operating systems facilitated the execution of 
jobs in an organised manner. </p>
<p class="answer"><b>The main disadvantages of batch operating systems are –</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) The jobs are executed on the basis of their arrival not 
as per their priority.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) The debugging of a program at execution time is not 
possible in these operating systems.</p>
<p class="answer">(c) The executing jobs may enter an infinite loop, as each 
job is not associated with a proper timer.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(ii) Multi-user Operating Systems</b> - The multi-user 
operating systems enable multiple users to use the resources of a computer 
system at the same time. This means that, it allows a number of users to work 
simultaneously on the same computer system. A multi-user system is usually 
implemented by following the multi-terminal configuration. In this type of 
configuration, a single powerful computer system is connected to multiple 
terminals through serial ports. This computer system is responsible for 
processing the different requests generated by the various terminals at the same 
time. The devices connected with the various terminals are keyboard, mouse, and 
monitor. The central computer system is equipped with a fast processor and a 
memory of large capacity for catering to the multiple requests of the end users. 
Examples of multi-user operating systems are Unix, Linux, Windows 2000 and 
VM-386.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>&nbsp;The main advantages of the multi-user operating systems 
are -</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) It allows the resources of the computer system to be 
utilized in an efficient manner.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) It enhances the overall productivity of the various 
users by providing simultaneous access to the various computer resources. </p>
<p class="answer"><b>The main disadvantages of the multi-user operating 
systems are –</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) The configuration of the computer system having 
multiuser operating system is complex and thus, is difficult to handle and 
maintain.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) This type of system may result in an inconsistent data 
if the activities of one user are not protected from another user.</p>
<p class="answer">(c) This type of operating system is needed to have robust 
security mechanisms.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(iii) Multi programmed Systems</b> – The most important 
aspect of job scheduling is the ability to multi programs. In general, a single 
user cannot keep either the CPU or the I/O devices busy at all times. 
Multiprogramming increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs so that the CPU 
always has one to execute. The idea is to keep several jobs in memory 
simultaneously. The operating system picks and begins to execute one of the jobs 
in the memory.</p>
<p class="answer">Eventually, the job may have to wait for some task, such as 
an I/O operation to complete. In a non multi programmed system, the CPU would 
sit idle. In a multiprogramming system, the operating system simply switches to, 
and executes, another job. When that jobs needs to wait, the CPU is switched to 
another jobs, and so on. Eventually, the first job finishes waiting and gets the 
CPU back. The CPU is never idle, as long as at least one job needs to execute.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(iv) Time-sharing Systems</b> – Multi programmed, 
batched systems provided an environment where the various system resources were 
utilized effectively, but it did not provide for user interaction with the 
computer system. Time sharing or multitasking is a logical extension of 
multiprogramming. The CPU executes multiple jobs by switching among them but the 
switches occur so frequently that the users can interact with each program while 
it is running.</p>
<p class="answer">A time-shared operating system allows many users to share 
the computer simultaneously. Each action or command in a time-shared system 
tends to be short, so only a little CPU time is needed for each user. As the 
system switches rapidly from one user to the next, each user is given the 
impression that the entire computer system is dedicated to his/her use, however, 
it is being shared among many users.</p>
<p class="answer">A time-shared operating system uses CPU scheduling and 
multiprogramming to provided each user with a small portion of a time-shared 
computer. Each user has at least one separate program in memory. A program 
loaded into memory and executing is called as a process. When a process 
executes, it executes for only a short time before it either finishes or needs 
to perform I/O.</p>
<p class="answer">Time-sharing operating systems are more complex than multi 
programmed operating systems. In both, several jobs must be kept simultaneously 
in memory, so the system must have memory management and protection. Examples of 
multitasking operating systems are Unix, Linux, Windows 2000, and Windows XP.
</p>
<p class="answer"><b>The main advantages of multitasking operating systems 
are –</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) It helps in increasing the overall performance of the 
computer system.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) It helps in increasing the overall productivity of the 
user by allowing a number of tasks at the same time.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>&nbsp;The disadvantages of multitasking operating systems are 
–</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) A large amount of memory is needed to execute several 
programs at the same time.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) Some mechanism needs to be implemented to ensure that 
the activities of one process do not interfere with the activities of another 
process.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(v) Real-time Operating Systems – </b>Real-time 
operating systems are used in environments where a large number of events, 
mostly external to the computer system, must be accepted and processed in a 
short time or within certain deadlines. Such applications are industrial 
control, telephone switching equipment, flight control, and real-time 
simulations.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>The real-time operating systems can be of two types</b> 
– hard real-time operating system and soft real-time operating system.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(a) Hard Real-time Operating System</b> – These 
operating systems guarantee that critical tasks be completed within a certain 
range of time. For example, a robot is hired to weld a car body, if robot welds 
too early or too late, the car cannot be sold , so it is a hard real-time system 
that require to complete car welding by robot hardly on the time.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(b) Soft Real-time Operating System</b> - This operating 
system provides some relaxation in time limit. For example - Multimedia systems, 
digital audio system etc.</p>
<p class="answer">Examples of real-time operating systems are M'TOS, Lynx, 
RTX. </p>
<p class="answer"><b>The advantages of the real-time operating systems are -</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) It is easy to design and develop and execute real-time 
applications under real-time operating system as compared to other types of 
operating systems.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) They are more compact than other operating systems. 
Thus, these systems need less memory space. </p>
<p class="answer"><b>The disadvantages of real-time operating systems are -</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) It is mainly focused on optimizing the execution time 
of an application and thus, it sometimes overlooks some of the other critical 
factors related to the overall efficiency of the computer system.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) It is only used for providing some dedicated 
functionality, and hence, cannot be used as a general-purpose operating systems.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(vi) Multiprocessor Operating Systems</b> - The 
multiprocessor operating system allows the use of multiple processors (i.e., 
CPUs) in a computer system for executing multiple processes at the same time. 
Therefore, these systems provide faster execution of processes than computer 
systems performing multiprocessing with a single CPU.</p>
<p class="answer">Examples are Unix, Linux, Windows 2000. </p>
<p class="answer"><b>The advantages of multiprocessor operating systems are 
as follows –</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) It helps in improving the overall performance and 
throughput of the computer system.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) It helps in increasing the reliability of the computer 
system.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>The disadvantages of multiprocessor operating systems 
are as follows –</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) The cost of the computer systems having multiprocessor 
operating systems is very high.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) A large amount of memory is needed for executing 
several user programs.</p>
<p class="answer"><b>(vii) Embedded Operating Systems</b> – These are 
somewhat similar to real-time operating systems. The embedded operating system 
is installed on an embedded computer system, which is mainly used for performing 
computational tasks in electronic devices. These operating systems provide 
limited functionality that is needed for the corresponding embedded computer.<br>
Examples are Palm OS and Windows CE. </p>
<p class="answer"><b>The advantages of embedded operating systems are –</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) These operating systems allow the implementation of 
embedded systems in an efficient manner.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) The computer system employing embedded operating 
systems is easy to use and maintain. </p>
<p class="answer"><b>The disadvantages of embedded operating systems are — :</b></p>
<p class="answer">(a) Only some specific operations can be performed with 
these operating systems.</p>
<p class="answer">(b) These operating systems cannot be used in frequently 
changing environments.</p>
