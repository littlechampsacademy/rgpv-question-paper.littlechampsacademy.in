Q.20: What are the main parts of Lathe? Describe four operations which can be performed in lathe.

Answer:<br>
The lathe machine consists of the following six basic parts:<br><br>
1.	Bed: The bed of a lathe acts as the base on which the different fixed and operating parts of the lathe are mounted. The top of the bed has two guideways to provide the support and the sliding surfaces for the carriage and the tailstock. The head stock is permanently fixed to the bed, the tailstock is adjustable for position to accommodate workpiece of the different lengths. The lathe bed being the main guiding member for accurate machining work, it should be sufficiently rigid to prevent deflection under cutting forces. Bed is made up of cast iron. <br><br>
<br><br>
2.	Headstock: The headstock is permanently fastened to the left hand end of the lathe bed. The main function of the headstock is to support the spindle and to house the main drive. Spindle is the hollow rotating shaft used for holding the workpiece. The work holding device such as chuck is mounted on the spindle. Main drive function is to drive the spindle and to change the spindle speed with the help of gear box mounted. The main drive is powered by an electric motor. Head stock is also called livestock as it turns with work. The feed shaft is used for most turning operations and lead screw is used for cutting threads. <br><br>
<br><br>
3.	Tailstock: The tailstock is located at the right hand end of the lathe bed. It can be moved along the guideways on the lathe bed and can be clamped in any position on the lathe bed. Its main function is to hold the dead center which can support the long workpiece during machining and to hold the tools like drill, reamer for carrying out operation like drilling, reaming or taping. <br><br>
<br><br>
4.	Carriage: The carriage is located between the headstock and tailstock of the lathe bed. It can slides along the guideways on the lathe bed. The main function of the carriage is to hold the cutting tool and to give longitudinal and/or cross feed to the cutting tool. <br><br>
<br><br>
5.	Drive: The center lathe has primarily two motions. The primary cutting motion and feed motion. These motions are accomplished by means of corresponding drives, which are system of mechanisms for transmitting power from its source (the electric motor) to the operative units of lathe that is to the spindle for primary cutting motion (main drive) and to the carriage for feed motion (feed drive)<br><br>
<br><br>
6.	Work holding device: The common work holding devices used for a center lathe are as follows:<br><br>
a)	Centers: Long workpiece (shaft or axle) with L/D ratio > 4, are turned lengthwise between centers. The workpiece in those ends center holes has been previously drilled and on which a driving dog has been clamped on one end is mounted between headstock and tailstock centers. The workpiece is rotated by driving the lathe dog. The lathe dog is driven with the help of a drive plate.<br><br>
b)	Chucks: Workpiece with a length L<4d may be clamped in a chuck without the need of additional support of the free end. It may be 3 jaw or four jaw chuck.<br><br>
c)	Mandrel: It can be described as solid shaft or spindle which is used for holding bored parts for machining their outside surfaces on lathe. Mandrels are usually employed for those jobs which have a finished hole which is concentric with the outer surface that is to be machined. <br><br>
Four basic operations performed on Lathe machine:<br><br>
1.	Turning: It is the process of removing the material from the cylindrical surface of the workpiece to reduce its diameter. In turning operation, the tool motion is longitudinal i.e. parallel to the axis of the lathe spindle. The tool used for the turning operation is called turning tool.<br><br>
2.	Facing: It is the process of removing the material from the end surface or face of workpiece. The facing operation produces a flat surface. The facing operation is used for reducing the length of the workpiece. In facing operation, the tool motion is perpendicular to the axis of the lathe spindle. The tool used for this operation is called facing tool.<br><br>
3.	Chamfering: it is a process of beveling the sharp edge of a workpiece. It is provided for avoiding the injuries to the persons handling the finished products. The tool used for this operation is called chamfering tool.<br><br>
4.	Grooving: It is a process of providing a narrow groove on the cylindrical surface of the workpiece. In this operation, the shape of the tool is reproduced on the workpiece.<br><br>
