Q.30: Write short notes on  Boiler mountings  
         </p><p class="answer"> <!-- <br> <br><img class="img-responsive" alt=" " width="auto" src = "./img/.jpg"/><br><br> -->
		 
Answer:<br>

<b>Boiler mountings</b><br><br>
There are different fittings and devices which are necessary for the operation and safety of boiler. These devices are mounted over boiler shell. The various boiler mountings are as follows:<br><br>
1.	Water level indicator: Its function is to indicate the level of water in the boiler constantly. It is also called water gauge. Normally two water level indicators are fitted at the front end of every boiler. When water is being heated in the boiler transforms into steam the level of water in the boiler shell goes on decreasing. For proper working of boiler. Water must be kept at certain level, if the water level falls below the certain level, boiler goes on producing steam without the addition of feed water, then great damage like crack and leak can occur to the parts of the boiler which are uncovered from water. This can result in the stoppage of steam generation and boiler operation.<br><br>
2.	Pressure gauge: Its function is to measure the pressure exerted inside the vessel. The gauge is mounted on the front top of the shell or the drum. It is usually contracted to indicate up to double the maximum pressure. They are of two types i.e. Bourdon tube pressure gauge and diaphragm type pressure gauge. <br><br>
3.	Safety valve: The function of the safety valve is to release the excess steam when the pressure of steam inside the boiler exceeds the rated pressure. As soon as the pressure of steam inside the boiler exceeds the rated pressure the safety valve automatically open and excess steam rushes out into the atmosphere till the pressure drops down to the normal value. It is fitted on the top of the shell. As per boiler regulation every boiler must be fitted with at least two safety valves.<br><br>
4.	Fusible plug: Its function is to protect the boiler against damage due to overheating for low water level. It is fitted on the fire box crown plate or over the combustion chamber. It consists of a hollow gun metal body screwed into the fire box crown. The body has a hexagonal flange to tighten it into the shell. A gun metal plug separated from the metal plug by an annulus of fusible metal. The fusible metal is protected from the fire by flange on the hollow gun metal plug. <br><br>
5.	Blow-off cock: It performs two functions: (a) It may discharge a portion of water when the boiler is in operation to blow out mud, scale or sediment periodically. (b) It may empty the boiler when necessary for cleaning, inspection and repair.   <br><br>
It is fitted on the boiler shell directly or to a short branch pipe at the lowest part of the water space. When more than one boiler is working and they drain in the same waste pipe line, an isolating valve is necessary to prevent the discharge of one boiler, from entering into the other. <br><br>
6.	Feed check valve: Its function is to control the supply of water to the boiler and to prevent the escaping of water from the boiler when the pump pressure is less or pump is stopped. The feed check valve is fitted in the water space of the boiler slightly below the normal level of water. <br><br>
7.	Junction or stop valve: It is valve which is placed directly over a boiler and connected to a steam pipe which carries steam to the engine. It is usually termed as stop valve. Junction valve and stop valve are essentially the same, the larger size are called junction valve and the smaller size are called stop valve. Its function is to regulate the flow of steam from one steam pipe to the other or from the boiler to the steam pipe. <br><br>
