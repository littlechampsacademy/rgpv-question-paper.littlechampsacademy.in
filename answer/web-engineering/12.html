		Q. :Discuss about copyright law.
			 
		  </p>
          <p class="answer">
Ans. Copyright law protects original works of authorship that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Works of authorship include the following categories - literary works (including computer programs); musical works (including the accompanying words); dramatic works (including accompanying music); pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; and architectural works.<br>
The basic elements of a copyright are expression and originality. The originality requirement is met if the work is independently created by an author and not copied from others. Further, originality does not require novelty. Accordingly, a work will not be denied copyright protection merely because it is similar to a work previously produced by someone else and, therefore, not novel. An author or creator, however, is entitled to a copyright only in the expression of a work and not in the idea underlying the work. Consequently, copyright does not extend to an idea or fact.<br>
For a work to be eligible for copyright protection, it must be "fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which [it] can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicate[ed], either directly or with the aid of a machine or a device. A work is fixed in a tangible medium of expression "when its embodiment in a copy or phono record, by or under the authority of the author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work, more than transitory duration.<br>
A copyright owner's right to reproduce his or her work is an important aspect of the exclusive rights afforded by copyright law. At the same time, it allows the owner to preclude all others from making copies of the work. Copies, as defined in the copyright act, are material objects in which a work is fixed "by any method now known or later developed." Accordingly, an Internet user that makes an unauthorized copy of a copyrighted work is likely to be violating the copyright owner's rights.<br>
A copyright owner also has the exclusive right to incorporate the work into derivative works and to exclude others from creating works based on his or her other work. The right of distribution assures the copyright owner of his or her right to the first distribution of the work. Thereafter, however, the first sale doctrine - which attempts to strike a balance between providing the copyright owner with the benefits of the copyright protection and permitting unimpeded circulation of the work - entitles the owner of a copy of a work to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of his or her copy of the work without the authority of the copyright owner.<br>
