		Q. :Discuss the concept of intellectual property rights.

          <p class="answer">
Ans. Intellectual property includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, designs, and know-how. Copyrights attract investments into the production and distribution of original, expressive information by promising authors and publishers a reward. It also gives them exclusive rights to such works. These copyrights protect a wide range of materials including musical lyrics, literary works, computer programs, and broadcasts. Copyright protection is automatic for any written work and circuit layouts; no formal applications have to be filed with the government. However, patents and trademarks must go through an application process. Timing of these applications is critical because they are awarded by the United States Patent Office on a first come first serve basis. Patents are awarded for inventions or nonobvious improvements to existing products or processes. Trademarks are awarded to any sign or symbol capable of distinguishing goods or services. Some well-known trademarks are the globe of AT&T, the star of Texaco, and the Coca-Cola sign. Intellectual property rights give the author exclusive ownership to the property at hand for an established amount of time (up to 17 years). Intellectual property rights are tools that can assist in licensing and franchising; they are considered an asset to the company that owns them and can be sold or traded as if they were tangible items.Without property laws, a producer of information will find it difficult to assess the information's value in the marketplace - information will not have any value if it cannot be sold. Selling of the information will expose it to the public and to competitors, to be copied and possibly resold at a lower price. If people or large corporations cannot get a return on their investment in the new developments, then they will be less inclined to invest in or produce new inventions. Property laws legitimize the fact that inventors can charge the public to access their works so that they can recover their investments. The charge for the information will happen even though access to it will benefit the consumer without any additional cost to the inventor. If the charges are such that the consumer cannot pay, or if the consumer refuses to pay, then the information may not be used though it could be beneficial for the public to have. As R. Cooter of Law and Economics said, "Put succinctly, the dilemma is that without legal monopoly not enough information will be produced, but with the legal monopoly too little of the information will be used."<br>
Intellectual property rights are not in place to prevent others from taking advantage of the new technology. In fact, they are supposed to be used to provide incentive to the inventor to share the discovery as much as possible. Some governments have restricted the exclusivity assumption of some rights. For example, the creator cannot stop others from using the work but has every right to demand and receive compensation. A means of limiting the inventor from keeping the creation from the rest of the world is to limit the amount of time the right is granted and excluding certain categories from being protected (such as some pharmaceuticals). Some countries, such as Canada, have even implemented a mandatory licensing system. The system allows the government the right to sell licensing of a product to other countries or businesses without the approval of the inventor, if the inventor has not made use of the invention within a set time frame. This system abrogates the exclusive rights of the inventors, however, they would still be compensated for the sale.<br>
