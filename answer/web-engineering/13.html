		Q. : Describe EP issues and copyright law.
			 
		  </p>
          <p class="answer">
Ans. The copyright act gives a copyright owner the exclusive right to distribute copies of the work to the public. On the Internet, it is possible to multicast a copy of a work from one host to a large number of other computers in seconds. Under the current law, however, it is not clear whether a transmission constitutes a distribution or not. The working group recommends that the copyright act be amended to reflect that copies of works distributed to the public by transmission fall within the exclusive distribution right of the copyright owner.<br>
The working group also saw the need to revise copyright law with respect to publication of copyright works. The legislative history of the copyright act makes clear that "any form of dissemination in which a material object does not change hands...is not a publication no matter how many people are exposed to the work." A transmission of a work on the Internet does not constitute publication; however, in the case of a transmission of a copyrighted work, the recipient of the transmission is thereafter in possession of a copy of the copyrighted work. Therefore, the working group recommended that the definition of publication be amended to include the concept of distribution by transmission.<br>
The working group has also been in favour of modifying copyright law to specify that the first sale doctrine does not apply to distribution by transmission. This doctrine allows the owner of a lawfully made copy of a work to dispose of it in any manner. "The first sale doctrine should not apply in the case of transmissions because a transmission involves both the reproduction of the work and the distribution of the reproduction. In the case of transmissions, the owner of a copy of a work does not dispose of the possession of that copy. A copy of the work remains with the first owner and the recipient receives a reproduction of the work.<br>
Many hold that the majority of works transferred from host to host may be subject to copyright protection. Any original expression fixed and transmitted on the Internet, posted on a bulletin board system, or communicated on an on¬line service is protected by copyright law because every time a file or message is transmitted, it results in copying and distributing the file or message.<br>
The following are some examples of copyright issues which might arise on the Internet. First, the author of messages posted to a message base or newsgroup is entitled to copyright protection and, although common, reposting the message will generally constitute a copyright violation unless the author of the message has relinquished his or her rights to the message or has given explicit permission to circulate the message. Second, digitized images are also often transmitted and distributed on bulletin board systems and services. The original creators of the digital image also have the protection of the copyright law, assuming the material was not in the public domain to begin with. Beyond the initial creators, any individuals copying or scanning the image are duplicating the work of someone else; if they do not have permission, they are also violating copyright law by duplicating and distributing the image. Third, a copyright violation occurs when copying software and transmitting it through the Internet. The copyright law is also applicable to e-mail - if an author has engaged in a creativity effort with regards to the content of the e-mail, copyright protection<br>
exists for the work sent through e-mail, whereby the creator may preempt a third party from using the work. It should be noted, however, that a copyright owner may waive his or her rights to copyright ownership in an e-mail work. Thus, it is imperative that the author consider the scope and applicability of any e-mail ownership waivers included in contracts used for access to the system itself.<br>
