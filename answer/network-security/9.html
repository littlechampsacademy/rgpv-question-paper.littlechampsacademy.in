		Q9: What is Phishing? Explain DNS based phishing.
			 
		  </p>
          <p class="answer">
Ans :  phishing refers to online identity theft in which confidential information is obtained from an individual. It is distinguished from offline identity theft such as card skimming and "dumpster diving," as well as from large-scale data compromises in which information about many individuals is obtained at once. Phishing includes many different types of attacks, including: • Deceptive attacks, in which users are tricked by fraudulent messages into giving out information; <br><br>
• Malware attacks, in which malicious software causes data compromises; and • DNS-based attacks, in which the lookup of host names is altered to send users to a fraudulent server (sometimes also referred to as "phanning"). Phishing targets many kinds of confidential information, including usemamcs and pass-words, social security numbers, credit-card numbers, bank account numbcrs, and personal information such as birthdates and mothers' maiden names. Phishing has been credibly estimated to cost US financial institutions in excess of SI billion a year in direct losses. Indirect losses arc much higher. including customer service expenses, account replacement costs, and higher expenses due to decreased use of online services in the face of widespread fear about the security of online financial transactions. Phishing also causes substantial hardship for victimized consumers, due to the difficulty of repairing credit damaged by fraudulent activity. <br><br>
Both the frequency of phishing attacks and their sophistication is increasing dramatically. Phishing often spans multiple countries and is commonly perpetrated by organized crime. While legal remedies can and should be pursued by affected institutions, technical measures to prevent phishing are an integral component of any long-term solution. This chapter examines technologies employed by phishers and evaluates technical coun-termeasures, both commercially available and proposed. <br><br>
DNS-based phishing is used here to refer generally to any form of phishing that interferes with the integrity of the lookup process for a domain name. This includes hosts file poison-ing, even though the hosts file is not properly part of the Domain Name System. Hosts file poisoning is discussed in the malware section since it involves changing a file on the user's computer. Another form of DNS based phishing involves polluting the user's DNS cache with incorrect information that will be used to direct the user to an incorrect location.
