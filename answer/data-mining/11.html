		Q.11 Explain time series mining association rules. 
			 
		  </p>
          <p class="answer">
<b>Ans.</b> A time series data made up of sequences of values or events that. change with time. Time series data is popular in many applications like the daily closing prices of a share in a stock market, the daily temperature value recorded at particular time intervals, and so on. The association rules mining can be partitioned into two categories according to the number of involved time series. The first one is association rules mining from single series and the second one is association rules mining from multiple series. The association rules mining can be viewed as the mining problem of sequential patterns. If we take the values of different series at same time as a transaction, the association rules mining problem from multiple series can be partitioned into two types – intra-transactional association rules mining and inter-transactional association rules mining.<br><br>
The mining algorithms can be used for traditional association rules to mine intra-transactional association rules from time series. However, the intra-transactional association rules can only show the co-relations of multiple time series at same time. It has little contribution to prediction, the ultimate destination of time series analysis. Taking stock data as an example, it can be found the rules like “If stock A goes up and stock B goes up then stock C will go up on the same day with intra-transactional rules, but it cannot be found the rules like” “If stock A goes up on the first day and stock B goes up on the second day then stock C will go up on the third day”. There is no difference between the items in the intra-transactional association rules, so it cannot be used to predict the trend of time series. <br><br>
The inter-transactional association rules describe the relations between different transactions. If we use it in multiple time series analysis, it can be  analyzed the relations of different series at different time. Therefore, it can be | used to find the rules like “If stock A goes up on the first day and stock B goes up on the second day then stock C will go up on the third day. It is obvious that in the example above the time dimension is added, the events in the rule occur in different time. They have sequential order in time dimension. If in an association different rule "X(0)=> Y(2)", event Y occurs two days after event X, then the rule will have the ability of prediction. According to this rule, while event X occurs some day, we can infer that event Y will most likely occur two days after.
