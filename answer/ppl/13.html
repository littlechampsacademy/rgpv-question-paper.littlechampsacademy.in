		Q. : Explain different elements which require storage during program execution.
			 
		  </p>
          <p class="answer">
The major program  and data elements requiring storage during program execution.  Code segments for translated user programs A major block of storage in any system must he  allocated to store the code segments representing the translated form of user programs, regardless  of whether programs are hardware- or software-interpreted. In the former case, programs are blocks  of executable machine code; in the latter case, blocks are in some intermediate form.   System run-time programs Another substantial block of storage during execution must be  allocated to system programs that support the execution of the user programs. These may range from  simple library routines; such as sine, cosine, or print-string functions, to software interpreters or  translators present during execution. Also included here are the routines that control run-time storage  management.   User-defined data structures and constants. Space for user data must be allocated for all data  structures declared in or created by user programs including constants.   Subprogram return points Subprograms may be invoked from different points in a program.<br><br>  Therefore, internally generated sequence-control information, such as subprogram return points,  coroutine resume points, or event notices for scheduled subprograms, must be allocated storage.   Referencing environments Storage of referencing environments (identifier associations) during  execution may require substantial space, as. for example, the LISP A-list.   Temporaries in expression evaluation. Expression evaluation requires the use of system-defined  temporary storage for the intermediate results of evaluation. For example, in evaluation of the  expression (x + y)x(u + v), the result of the first addition may have to be stored in a temporary  while the second addition is performed. When expressions involve recursive function calls, a potentially  unlimited number of temporaries may be required to store partial results at each level of recursion.   Temporaries in parameter transmission. When a subprogram is called, a list of actual parame-  ters must be evaluated and the resulting values stored in temporary storage until evaluation of the  entire list is complete. Where evaluation of one parameter may require evaluation of recursive func-  tion calls. a potentially unlimited amount of storage may be required, as in expression evaluation.   Input-output buffer& Ordinarily input and output operations work through buffers, which  serve as temporary storage areas where data are stored between the time of the actual physical transfer  of the data to or from external storage and the program-initiated input and output operations.   Miscellaneous system data. In almost every language implementation, storage is required for  various system data: tables, status information for input-output, and various miscellaneous pieces of  state information (e.g., reference counts or garbage-collection bits).   Besides the data and program elements requiring storage. various operations may require storage  to be allocated or freed. The following are the major operations:   Subprogram call and rerun: operations The allocation of storage for a subprogram activation  record, the local referencing environment, and other data on call of a subprogram is often the major  operation requiring storage allocation. The execution of a subprogram return operation usually  requires freeing of the storage allocated during the call.   <br>
