	1. What are the different factors that influences the evolution of programming languages?   	
			
		  </p>
          <p class="answer">
Ans : Different language evaluation criteria are<br><br>
<b>Readability<br></b>
Software development was largely thought of in term of writing code “LOC”.<br>
Language constructs were designed more from the point of view of the computer than the users. Because ease of maintenance is determined in large part by the readability of programs, readability became an important measure of the quality of programs and programming languages.  The result is a crossover from focus on machine orientation to focus on human orientation. The most important criterion “ease of use”<br><br>
<b>Writability<br></b>
It is a measure of how easily a language can be used to create programs for a chosen problem domain.<br>
Most of the language characteristics that affect readability also affect writability.<br>
Simplicity and orthogonality<br>
A smaller number of primitive constructs and a consistent set of rules for combining them is much better than simply having a large number of primitives.<br>
Support for abstraction<br>
Abstraction means the ability to define and then use complicated structures or operations in ways that allow many of the details to be ignored.<br>
A process abstraction is the use of a subprogram to implement a sort algorithm that is required several times in a program instead of replicating it in all places where it is needed.<br><br>
<b>Expressivity<br></b>
It means that a language has relatively convenient, rather than cumbersome, ways of specifying computations.<br>
Ex: ++count	⇔	count = count + 1 // more convenient and shorter<br><br>
<b>Reliability<br></b>
A program is said to be reliable if it performs to its specifications under all conditions.<br>
Type checking: is simply testing for type errors in a given program, either by the compiler or during program execution.<br>
The earlier errors are detected, the less expensive it is to make the required repairs.  Java requires type checking of nearly all variables and expressions at compile time.<br>
Exception handling: the ability to intercept run-time errors, take corrective measures, and then continue is a great aid to reliability.<br>
Aliasing: it is having two or more distinct referencing methods, or names, for the same memory cell.<br>
It is now widely accepted that aliasing is a dangerous feature in a language. Readability and writability: Both readability and writability influence reliability.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Cost<br></b>
Categories<br>
Training programmers to use language<br>
Writing programs “Writability”<br>
Compiling programs<br>
Executing programs<br>
Language implementation system “Free compilers is the key, success of Java”<br>
Reliability, does the software fail?<br>
Maintaining programs: Maintenance costs can be as high as two to four times as much as development costs.<br>
Portability “standardization of the language”<br>
Generality (the applicability to a wide range of applications)<br>
