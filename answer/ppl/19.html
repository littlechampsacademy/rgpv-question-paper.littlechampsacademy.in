		Q. : Write short note:	<br>i) Activation records 		<br>ii) 4GL 		<br>iii) Dangling pointers 
			 
		  </p>
          <p class="answer">
  Ans: <br><b>Activation records</b>   The activation record is a block of memory on the control stack used to manage information  for every single execution of a procedure. Each activation has its own activation record with the root of  activation tree at the bottom. The path from one activation to another in the activation tree is determined  by the corresponding sequence of activation records on the control stack.   Different languages have different activation record contents. In FORTRAN, the activation records  arc stored in the static data arca while in C and Pascal. the activation records arc stored in stack arca.  The contents of activation records are shown in Figure 9.3. The various fields of activation record are as follows:<br>
•	 Temporaries: The temporaries are used to store intermediate    results that are generated during the evaluation of an expression    and cannot be held in registers.<br>
•	 Local data: This field contains local data like local variables, which    are local to the execution of a procedure stored in the activation    record.<br>
•	 Saved machine status: This field contains the information    regarding the state of a machine just before the procedure is called.    This information consists of the machine register contents and the    return address (program counter value).<br>
•	 Access link: It is an optional field and also called static link field. It is a link to non-local data in    some other activation record which is needed by the called procedure.<br>
•	 Control link: It is also an optional field and is called dynamic link field. It points to the activation    record of the calling procedure. <br>
•	 Returned value: It is also an optional field. It is not necessary that all the procedures return a   value, but if the procedure does, then for better efficiency this field stores the return value of the   called procedure.<br>
•	 Actual parameters: This field contains the information about actual parameters which are used by   the calling procedure.<br>

           <b> ii) A fourth-generation programming language (4GL)</b> is a computer programming language envisioned as a refinement of the style of languages classified as third-generation programming language (3GL). Each of the programming language generations aims to provide a higher level of abstraction of the internal computer hardware details, making the language more programmer-friendly, powerful and versatile. While the definition of 4GL has changed over time, it can be typified by operating more with large collections of information at once rather than focus on just bits and bytes. Languages claimed to be 4GL may include support for database management, report generation, mathematical optimization, GUI development, or web development. Fourth-generation languages have often been compared to domain-specific languages (DSLs). Some researchers state that 4GLs are a subset of DSLs.<br>
<br>
The concept of 4GL was developed from the 1970s through the 1990s, overlapping most of the development of 3GL. While 3GLs like C, C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript remain popular for a wide variety of uses, 4GLs as originally defined found narrower uses. Some advanced 3GLs like Python, Ruby, and Perl combine some 4GL abilities within a general-purpose 3GL environment. Also, libraries with 4GL-like features have been developed as add-ons for most popular 3GLs. This has blurred the distinction of 4GL and 3GL.         <br>
                   <br>
<b>iii) Dangling Pointer : </b> <br>
A dangling pointer is a pointer variable that contains an invalid or deallocated address. Dangling pointers are a danger because the referenced memory area can contain a constant, invalid data, or garbage. Since pointers can be used to direct program execution, a dangling pointer could be the cause of a crash, specially in programs that execute in real mode. In x86 architecture the addresses at the beginning of memory are reserved for the interrupt vector table. Therefore it would be possible, in the x86 machine environment, to assign a zero value to any uninitialized or invalid pointer and check for this value before using it. However, C++ provides no internal checks for dangling pointers, which are the programmer's responsibility.<br>
